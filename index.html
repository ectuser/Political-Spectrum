				<p class="descriprion">Bolshevism is the term used to describe the beliefs and practices of the Bolsheviks, the members of a political movement in Russia during the early 20th century.  Bolsheviks were a faction of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) which split apart from the Menshevik faction at the Second Party Congress in 1903. The RSDLP was a revolutionary socialist political party formed in 1898 in Minsk in Belarus to unite the various revolutionary organisations of the Russian Empire into one party. <span class="link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks" target="_blank">[wiki]</a></span></p>

				<p class="descriprion">Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis that analyzes class relations and societal conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and a dialectical view of social transformation. It originates from the mid-to-late 19th century works of German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. <span class="link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism" target="_blank">[wiki]</a></span></p>

				<p class="descriprion">Maoism is one of the forms of Marxism; a political theory derived from the teachings of the Chinese political leader Mao Zedong (1893â€“1976). The essential difference between Maoism and other forms of Marxism is that Mao claimed that peasants should be the essential revolutionary class in China, because, contrary to their industrial working "comrades", they were more suited to establishing a successful revolution and socialist society in China.<span class="link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism" target="_blank">[wiki]</a></span></p>

It derives its name from Gregor and Otto Strasser, the two Nazi brothers initially associated with this position.<span class="link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasserism" target="_blank">[wiki]</a></span></p>

				<p class="descriprion">Nationalism is a multidimensional concept reflected in the communal identification with one's nation. It is a political ideology oriented towards gaining and maintaining self-governance, or full sovereignty, over a territory of historical significance to the group (such as its homeland). Nationalism therefore holds that a nation should govern itself, free from unwanted outside interference, and is linked to the concept of self-determination. Nationalism is further oriented towards developing and maintaining a national identity based on shared characteristics such as culture, language, race, religion, political goals or a belief in a common ancestry. Nationalism therefore seeks to preserve the nation's culture. It often also involves a sense of pride in the nation's achievements, and is closely linked to the concept of patriotism. In these terms, nationalism can be considered positive or negative, in some cases it meant that a nation should be able to control the government and all means of production.<span class="link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism" target="_blank">[wiki]</a></span></p>

The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before it spread to other European countries. Opposed to liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism, fascism is usually placed on the far-right within the traditional leftâ€“right spectrum.<span class="link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism" target="_blank">[wiki]</a></span></p>
