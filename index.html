				<p class="descriprion">Bolshevism is the term used to describe the beliefs and practices of the Bolsheviks, the members of a political movement in Russia during the early 20th century.  Bolsheviks were a faction of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) which split apart from the Menshevik faction at the Second Party Congress in 1903. The RSDLP was a revolutionary socialist political party formed in 1898 in Minsk in Belarus to unite the various revolutionary organisations of the Russian Empire into one party. <span class="link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks" target="_blank">[wiki]</a></span></p>

It originates from the mid-to-late 19th century works of German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. <span class="link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism" target="_blank">[wiki]</a></span></p>
